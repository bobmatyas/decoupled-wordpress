# Decoupled WordPress API Project

This project is based on [the JavaScript for WordPress](https://javascriptforwp.com) course for the section on the WordPress REST API.

## Project Requirements

- Make Decoupled HTTP Requests with JavaScript
- Use Endpoints: post, category, tag, comment, user, page, and media
- Include use of links, embeds and arguments
- Build a site similar to the demo (or your own design)
- Architect as a Single Page Web App

## My Solution

My solution is vanilla JavaScript with no frameworks. I used Bootstrap for the styling so that I wouldn't have to spend time on the visual parts of the site.
